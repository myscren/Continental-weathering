
1. We applied the code from Lipp et al.(2021) to calculate the continental weathering simulation curve

2. We compiled codes (MATLAB) to calculate the time series of other weathering indicators :
(1) CIA, CIW, PIA and WIP data source were from Lipp et al.(2021).
(2) K/Al and Rb/Al data source were  from Bayon et al.(2022).

3. The data used for calculate the time series of Phosphorous are from Reinhard et al.(2017).
